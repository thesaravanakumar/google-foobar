	Power Hungry
	============
	Commander Lambda's space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday 
	devices take even more power. To help meet the station's power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the 
	station's outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar 
	panels. You and your team of henchmen has been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you can't take them all down at 
	once without shutting down the space station (and all those pesky life support systems!).

	You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the 
	maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you'll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each 
	array actually is. Write a function answer(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each 
	panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array 
	contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the 
	subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30. So answer([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be "30".

	Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level 
	whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they're draining energy, but you 
	know a trick with the panels' wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive 
	output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the answer as a string 
	representation of the number.

	Test cases
	============
	Inputs:

	(int list) xs = [2, 0, 2, 2, 0]
	Output:

	(string) "8"
	Inputs:

	(int list) xs = [-2, -3, 4, -5]
	Output:

	(string) "60"
